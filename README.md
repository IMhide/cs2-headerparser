This is a working repo in order to build a proper header parser for CS2 Demo
The goal is to make a contribution to github.com/markus-wa/demoinfocs-golang 

To get the demo I'm using in the main.go you can download them at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BdIbBezunpm4Hh9RbzqAFQCC8yNvjotR?usp=drive_link

Feel free to also edit the main.go if  you wanna use your own demo
